			I have written a book about MKUltra. I don’t favour that word, because it seems sensationalist and appears to refer to a different time and place, but it describes the sexual violence and mind control that I experienced.
			<br>
			<br>
			It is very difficult to find adequate words for such life-altering experiences—it’s perhaps impossible to communicate the scope of these human experience by saying, for example, ‘I’ve been through a war’, or ‘I was raped’. Words, just words: child rape, brainwashing, genocide.
			<br>
			<br>
			This difficulty of expressing traumatic human experience also applies to mystical vision, or mystical relationship. When I experience my self and the world differently within this relationship, which I call becoming the song rather than the singer, this can be nigh on impossible to express.
			<br>
			<br>
			It has been the work of my autobiography, <i>Untold Intelligence</i>, to communicate both. On the one hand, the terrible suffering that produced post-traumatic dissociative identity disorder. On the other hand, the wonder of intimacy with divine intelligence. Incidentally, I know that there’s a movement against psychiatric labels like ‘dissociative identity disorder’ in feminist thinking. On Twitter, <a href="https://www.drjessicataylor.com/" target="_blank">Dr Jessica Taylor</a> once asked me “How do you have a ‘disordered’ ‘personality’?” I wouldn’t want to argue as I am aligned with protests against victims of abuse <img class="left tweet-dr-taylor" src="DrJTaylor.jpg" alt="Dr Jessica Taylor Tweet"> being categorised, as such, as ‘mad, bad or dangerous’, and I write about the delusions of the allegation of madness in my book. I also think that this psychiatric terminology has gone some way in usefully <i>describing</i> what happens to the self after trauma, even if there are other ‘languages’ to better talk about this. Referring to the esoteric tradition that I relate to, I say that I write about ‘being after shattering’, and this has enabled me to contextualise my suffering within culture and history rather than seeing it as utterly unique. Even if I am unique!
			<br>
			<br>
			For many years, I worked in England and Ireland as a human rights lawyer, acting for torture survivors and refugees, but I finally turned to my own story of terror. How, after so much human betrayal and pain, in such a broken world, could there be trust and love within a greater reality? Difficult questions that brought me to write about visiting underground sex clubs, suicide, murder, and the Holocaust.
			<br>
			<br>
			I’ve told the story of my self—more than my self—being taken from me by referring to all the works of art and literature that have kept me company within terrible loss: <i>Morvern Callar;</i> Stanley Kubrick’s work; books and films by French writer Marguerite Duras. Psychiatrist R. Loewenstein  described dissociative identity disorder as “a never-assembled psychological jigsaw puzzle, not a shattered mirror”. 1 Putting together the pieces of my story from years and years of childhood, adolescent and adult diaries was a puzzle but it became prayer. In the writing groups that I facilitate with survivors of child abuse and rape, with my group, ‘Survivors With Biros’, we often practise ‘lament’ and ‘gratitude’ writing. My book is a celebration in great gratitude of being spiritually and erotically awakened, of real relationship, but it is also a lament for terrible shattering, of the self and of the world.
