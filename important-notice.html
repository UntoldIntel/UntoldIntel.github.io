				Unfortunately, you may already know that publication of ‘Untold Intelligence’ on 28 May 2023 has been cancelled, as some legal issues have arisen and Troubador is currently unable to publish my book as is.
				<br>
				<br>
				This is evidently very disappointing—or ‘triggering’—and yet I am not discouraged from the peaceful path in which I am walking, despite cancellation of the book on which I worked so very hard (producing the marble painting for the cover by hand, obtaining costly permissions from song lyric publishers and other copyright holders in the UK and abroad, and months of intensive research, writing, editing and typesetting).
				<br>
				<br>
				Individuals, libraries or bookshops in Israel, Germany, America, Canada, the UK and Ireland had told me that they would pre-order, or had pre-ordered my book, so I know that what I had to say was of interest.
				<br>
				<br>
				In lieu of the planned online book launch event on 28 June 2023, a short video (just under twenty minutes) in which I speak about writing will be posted on my YouTube account on 28 May 2023.
