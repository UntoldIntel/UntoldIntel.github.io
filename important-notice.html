			<h1>Important Notice 17-05-23</h1>
			<p>
				My story is of surviving what can be called #MKUltra in England. Today because of legal threats to stop publication of my memoir I have had to part company with my publisher who felt that they had to put their interests above my own. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				I haven't been shouting from the rooftops about my book, 'Untold Intelligence', or indeed about the story of my terrible suffering. That isn't really my style. I can use a loudhailer like the rest but I prefer relational conversations, as this is how lives change.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				However I realised a couple of years ago that it was an urgent necessity to write my book, in the interest of the world, rather than of those few who were watching me. God helped me to do so with many miracles. I wrote about them, too. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				I preferred to tell my story by connecting with those who helped me write it. #Kubrick who could see what was going on. #Duras who explained that there is no word for some traumas (even though the law would try, here: 'rape', 'trafficking', 'terrorism', 'genocide', 'murder').
				<br>	
				<br>	
				#Lacan and #Blake who saw alternative realities to those of consensus reality, which excludes so much, and kept the faith in us. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				I could retell me story simply as #spiritual awakening, which it was, as the moral of all my story is 'God will see'. But I won't be silenced in speaking of the trauma, because that is an important part of the truth. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				The details are also everything unless we believe that the goal of mystical relationship is to cut off from this world, not to try to change it for the better, to become sequestered from human life. I don't think so. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				After all, how could we have learnt of the strength of the Jews without mention of the crimes of the Egyptians? How could we tell of the journey afterwards without noting and remembering #Amalek in order to forget Amalek? 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				I will tell the truth, because it is second nature to me, like praying, as I am now. But for the moment, if you have bought copies of my book on preorder I cannot say what will happen as I am not privy to that information. You should contact Troubador.
